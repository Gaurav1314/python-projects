<h2>
A short history of the company
</h2>
<p>
World Wide Spamwas started in the summer of 2000. The business
concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both trough
bulk email and by selling canned meat online.
</p>
<p>
After receiving several complaints from costumers who weren't
satisfied by their bulk email, World Wide Spam altered their profile,
and focused 100% on canned goods. Today, they rank as the world's
13,892nd online supplier of <strong>SPAM</strong>.
